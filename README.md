# AIMoodAnalyser
This project creates a Ruby on Rails application that provides a web API for sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis is a technique used to determine the emotional tone behind a series of words. The application leverages a pre-trained AI model to analyze text and return whether the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
